datafun
=======

Small programs that perform a function on your data.



Why?
----

Matlab is expensive, Octave sucks, you're too lazy to learn R, and you're a fan of the Unix philosophy of programs that do one thing well.


Usage
-----

At this time, has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.8. I'd expect it to work on Linux. I have no idea if it will work on Windows, although I don't see why it wouldn't if you use minggw or clang (Windows). Not sure if Visual Studio will work since Visual Studio doesn't contain a C compiler.


### install

    git clone https://github.com/jprichardson/datafun.git && cd datafun && make && make install
